# Documentation guide

## New documentation standards

1. All new documentation should be in `Markdown` format. Except index files and
   special cases.
2. However, usage of RST blocks is not restricted.

## Update of old documentation guide

Old documentation files, partly located in `docs/source.old` folder. You can take
any file from there and update it for new version.

1. First check is information is anyhow connected to `geocoder3` project, or
   completely absolute.
2. If information is completely outdated - remove related file, and make a PR with
   description of delete reason.
3. If information has sense, please update a file, convert it to `Markdown` and
   include in current documentation.
